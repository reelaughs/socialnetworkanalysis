# Social network analysis
Assignment for MSc Information Systems at NTU, for the module Graph Analysis, Learning and Applications. 

The task required the analysis two real-world social networks using NetworkX (Python package). THe first was an undirected graph via a downloaded Facebook dataset retrieved from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html. THe second was a directed graph via an Epinions dataset retrieved from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-Epinions1.html. I also put together a report discussing findings and patterns derived from the analysis.
For each dataset, we were required to compute, analyse and present in particular:
1) Basic statistics such as the no. of nodes, no. of edges, CLustering coefficient, Graph density, Graph diameter
2) Top-5 Nodes by Degree (by In-degree and Out-degree for the Directed graph) 
3) Node Importance Analysis: Evaluate the importance of these top 5 nodes using centrality measures such as Degree centrality, Closeness centrality, Betweenness centrality, PageRank etc.
4) Node Similarity Analysis: Assess the similarity between the top 5 nodes using metrics such as Shortest path distance, Common neighbors, Jaccard coefficient, Adamic-Adar index, Resource allocation index etc.
5) Plot the degree distribution for all nodes and analyze patterns

For in and out degrees respectively with in-degree being represented by the green and
out-degree by the blue:
